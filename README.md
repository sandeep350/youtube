# YouTube-Style Video Gallery

This project is a simple responsive HTML and CSS-based video gallery inspired by the YouTube video layout. It displays a series of video thumbnails along with related metadata such as video titles, channel information, and view counts.

## Features

- Responsive layout using CSS
- Search bar placeholder for future functionality
- Video cards styled consistently
- Thumbnails and profile images included
- Organized video metadata (title, author, views, and post time)

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the video gallery.
- `style`: Embedded in `<style>` tag inside `index.html`.
- Image assets:
  - Thumbnails: `one.png` to `twelve.png`
  - Profile pictures: `pic1.png` to `pic12.png`

## Structure

Each video block includes:
- Thumbnail image
- Profile picture
- Title
- Channel name
- View count and time since upload

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure all image files (`one.png` to `twelve.png`, `pic1.png` to `pic12.png`) are placed in the same directory as `index.html`.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser to view the layout.

## Future Improvements

- Add JavaScript functionality to filter/search videos based on title or channel.
- Improve responsiveness with media queries.
- Link video cards to actual video pages or embedded players.
- Optimize layout for mobile devices.
